[http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/)


### Documentation
All of the possible default functions are included in `index.jsx`. These are pulled from [the official documentation](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht).


### Setup

1. Clone the repository. Into your Ãœbersicht widgets folder.
2. Update `widget.json` with your information.
3. Update `package.json` with your information.
4. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
5. Quit and re-open Ãœbersicht.

Your widget should be running. ðŸ’µ


### Distribution
Use the Makefile to create a distribution version of the widget.


### Ãœbersicht, Accessibility, and clicking links
Ãœbersicht has a preference for an Interaction Shortcut that allows widget elements to be clicked while holding a configured modifier key. Out of the box, Ãœbersicht doesn't ask for Accessibility access, so this preference doesn't appear to work at first. Add Ãœbersicht to the list of apps in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility in order for this to work as expected.

Once the Interaction Shortcut is allowed and configured, the story titles and discussion links are clickable and will open in your default browser.
